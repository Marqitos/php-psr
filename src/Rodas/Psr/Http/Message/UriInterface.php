 * Value object representing a URI.

 * provide methods for most common operations. Additional functionality for
 * working with URIs can be provided on top of the interface or externally.
 * Its primary use is for HTTP requests, but may also be used in other
 * contexts.
 *
 * Instances of this interface are considered immutable; all methods that
 * might change state MUST be implemented such that they retain the internal
 * state of the current instance and return an instance that contains the
 * changed state.
 *
 * Typically the Host header will be also be present in the request message.
 * For server-side requests, the scheme will typically be discoverable in the
 * server parameters.
